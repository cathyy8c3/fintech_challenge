BTC_24h,0.07477891602585236,"[[""Last week, BTC continued its fall, dropping to a six-month low. This level is more than 50% down from BTC's all-time high of $69,000 and the fall had a knock-on effect on altcoin prices and DeFi tokens in general.\n\nHowever, on a technical and fundamental level, there's plenty to be positive about. Bitcoin's Relative Strength Index (RSI) dipped to its lowest level since March 2020, well below the ''oversold'' zone. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's total market cap finds itself at the next major level of support.\n\n\nFundamentally, BTC recorded a new all-time high mining difficulty of 26.643 trillion with an average hash rate of 190.71 exahashes per second. This signals strong support in the Bitcoin community despite the ongoing bear market. According to data from BTC.com, the Bitcoin network is set to grow stronger in the next 12 days, consequently achieving another all-time high."", 1643044117], [""This morning before Wall Street opened, I explained why I thought this last week of the first month of 2022 would be a good one - a small reversal of the declining trend we've been seeing since November.\n\n[https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/sbg39a/this\\_is\\_why\\_the\\_last\\_week\\_of\\_january\\_will\\_be\\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/sbg39a/this_is_why_the_last_week_of_january_will_be_a/)\n\nThe thread was obviously flooded with doomsayers predicting 32K, even 30K BTC ... with zero supporting evidence other than their own short positions and self interest.\n\nAs someone who rarely trades with leverage and has zero leverage in play right now, it's easy to take a look at the market and realise that we're at a turning point - not just for the reasons outlined in my previous post, but also because the last remnants of 2021 will be settled this week: BTC Futures from December. That's why we're seeing this huge tug-of-war between the ideal bearish scenario (33K or below) and the ideal bullish scenario (35K or higher). If bulls can push over the 36K line, it will need another serious selloff over night to see the bears break 33K again.\n\nOver the past week we have seen multiple bearish attempts to turn the market downward towards 32K - each time we came a little closer, the rebound was faster. It will continue to be so.\n\nSource: look at my post history of predictions from CRO back in the autumn before it did a x10 to posts  discussing Whale fuckery and how to think like a top feeder and not a shrimp.\n\nWe're still not out of the woods yet, but if we can maintain 36.5K by the weekend, February will be a good month.\n\nAs usual, NFA / DYOR."", 1643046595], ['[removed]', 1643047031], ['', 1643049411], ['It\'s really frustrating seeing so many posts pumping coins as an alternative to Bitcoin while everything in the entire crypto market is skyrocketing upward, pretending they\'re somehow better automatically because of a percentage increase in a short amount of time.\n\nEven as a holder of some ETH it really pains me to see the misguided posts about the eventual ""flippening"" of ETH (or ADA) specifically eventually overtaking BTC\'s market cap based solely on hype or empty promises.\n\nAnyone who\'s been here even since 2017 at this point knows this happens over and over again.

Example - if you take any of the top 10 coins, the BTC trading pair is not even in the top 10 places by volume. \n\nStablecoins dominate trading, and its no surprise that 2 stablecoins make the top 10, and another 2 more in the top 15.

Cryptocurrencies, while different in very many ways, are still very dependent on each other. When one crypto starts to rise or fall, chances are other cryptos are going to follow the same trend. For instance, every single time the price of Bitcoin rises, the price of altcoins rises as well. But why does this happen? If you ever thought of the correlation between cryptocurrencies and why altcoins follow Bitcoin, [this article is for you.](https://swapzone.io/blog/altcoins-and-bitcoin?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=promo)  \nCryptocorrelation is a term used to describe the behavior of one cryptocurrency towards the behavior of another. Market analysts and experts discovered the first correlation between cryptocurrencies in 2017 when the collapse of Bitcoin led to the eventual drop in the capitalization of all other cryptocurrencies. The fact that Bitcoin jump-started the whole crypto industry has enabled it to have the final say regarding market sentiment. Additionally, traders and investors almost always check Bitcoin before deciding whether or not to sell their altcoin positions.\n\nSimultaneously, there are times when a drop in Bitcoin’s value leads to a surge in an altcoin’s value. The most reasonable explanation for this is that investors will usually pull their capital out of Bitcoin investments and simply channel it to a promising altcoin. This action leads to a fundamental increase in the particular altcoin. Additionally, a promising altcoin that receives market hype, is capable of experiencing a bull-run all on its own. Therefore, it isn’t entirely true that all altcoins depend on Bitcoin.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ywvwrzmpetd81.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39e0810e1303b73e953ba3a75f193dc20cbb1524', 1643108745], ['', 1643112890], [""While reports of large gains on alts attract many people to the crypto world, I'm ready to bet that nearly every traditional/retail investor would be thrilled about the potential gains of  BTC and ETH.\n\nA good reason to invest in them is because they are considered as blue chips.

In this case, we're talking about cryptos, and a blue chip coin is one that has a market capital of more than $ 2 billion.\n\nAnother reason to invest in them is because of it’s support to projects like Qtum and Envision which brings the best of both coins mentioned in this [article](https://cryptobullsclub.com/best-innovative-peer-to-peer-exchange-networks/).

We are about to witness game theory play out in real time. If you want to buy, this is the quite literally the perfect opportunity. \n\nIt’s been a while since BTC was heading this low. It was flirting with $29,800 in July 2021 but since then, a lot of major institutional and investor money has been flowing in to the market, all while the number of BTC available on exchanges is decreasing by the day. The number of bitcoins being stored by investors, retail and even miners is going up day by day. Bitcoin is also on the cusp of exponential mass adoption, Google are actively developing support for Bitcoin in its payment wallet and eventually Apple will have to follow too. \n\nAll of this equates to the fact that right now, BTC is probably at the most undervalued price it’ll ever be. I don’t see BTC falling below $30k again, the support at $40k has been very positive for a while now. The days of 70%&gt; corrections are long gone. \n\nI believe the news from Russia moving to ban cryptocurrency may have something to do with the market’s reaction. The FUD from the energy meeting was handled relatively well, however the ban from Russia was a pretty big blow considering the fact that Putin had a neutral/somewhat positive opinion on BTC and cryptocurrency. The sudden change in direction was turbulent and the market shows. But now that’s it. Who else is left to ban that even matters at global level with significant macroeconomic and geopolitical influence? The free market has already responded. America is officially the home of cryptocurrency and now even Intel are designing ASICS. We will witness trillions of liquidity flow into the bitcoin network and the mining industry over the next decade and it’s going to be an all American pie (pun definitely intended, hilarious movies). Russia and China will be forced to either mine or buy back in if they want a slice of the pie.\n\nWhat does all of this mean? We are witnessing history unfold right before us. Front row seats to the game theory itself at a global scale. Bitcoin will probably never be  at these prices ever again and every other long term metric indicates a massive explosion.

Well, it\'s whatever the miners are being paid by participating in the network. It\'s the reason people mine, contributing enough hashrate that it\'s unprofitable or unfeasible for attackers to attempt a double-spend, censorship attacks, etc. If the security budget were zero, then only hobbyist miners would mine. This would clearly not be enough hashpower to support a network that holds billions of dollars of value, because any old mining farm or group of trolls could come online and double-spend whenever they felt like it, or accept bribes to censor certain transactions. Bitcoin as a network would gain a reputation as being unreliable, and the price of BTC would plummet. Not sound money!\n\nBut we don’t have zero budget, we have issuance (the block reward) and transaction fees. Issuance value is equal to Bitcoin price times block reward. So if issuance drops but Bitcoin price goes up just as much, the budget is maintained. Exponential BTC price increase means the network gets to maintain its security through halvenings. But what happens when that stops?\n\nShort answer is that users have to pay all the security budget as fees. It’s not established that the demand to use the Bitcoin network is sufficient to support this. The current security budget per block (to keep the network running for \\~10 minutes), using rough values from recent weeks is:\n\nbudget = block reward \\* BTC price + transaction fees\n\n= 6.25 BTC/block \\* 31000 USD/BTC + $10/transaction \\* 2000 transactions/block\n\n= $213750/block, or $106/transaction\n\nIf Bitcoin continues to grow in value, the budget must also increase in kind to maintain security, and this burden falls on the users. Not to mention the majority of this cost goes to burning electricity and manufacturing single-use computers, which is terrible for the environment and climate.\n\nEven if users decide this is all fine and they’re OK with paying $100 and growing to send BTC, a fee-dominated reward structure actually has been shown to [degrade in a game-theoretic sense](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arvindn/publications/mining_CCS.pdf). Miners who want to maximize profit can do so by mining empty blocks, and from there the system devolves into a melange of various selfish-mining strategies that reduce performance of the network further, driving up costs.\n\nBitcoin was a genius, revolutionary invention, but in the long term and on a large scale it’s a time bomb. Not sound money. Other networks have largely solved these problems - without the need to compensate miners for wasting electricity and hardware, and with more advanced consensus algorithms, the security budget can be much lower to maintain a greater level of security and ability to recover from attacks.', 1611770058], ['**Bitcoin(BTC) Basic Info:** [Website](https://bitcoin.org) - r/Bitcoin - [Abstract](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Bitcoin_basicinfo#wiki_short_description) - [History](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Bitcoin_basicinfo#wiki_history) - [Exchanges](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Bitcoin_basicinfo#wiki_exchanges) - [Wallets](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Bitcoin_basicinfo#wiki_wallets) \n\n**Biases(Updated July, 2019):** [Arguments For](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Bitcoin_pros) &amp; [Arguments Against](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/Bitcoin_cons) | **CryptoWikis:** [Policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/policy#wiki_cryptowikis_program_-_.28work_in_progress.29) - [Contribute](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoWikis/wiki/contributing)\n\n---\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Going forward, they will be known as Ethereum’s “execution layer” and “consensus layer,” respectively.\n\nNew Ethereum Terminology\nIn a Monday\xa0blog post, the Ethereum Foundation announced that it would retire the terminologies “ETH 1.0” and “ETH 2.0” in favor of the terms “execution layer” and “consensus layer.”\nThe “execution layer”—formerly known as Ethereum 1.0—refers to the Proof-of-Work blockchain that is known today as Ethereum. The Proof-of-Stake Beacon Chain, which is intended to take over consensus processes after the merging of the two blockchains, will henceforth be known as the “consensus layer.” Taken together, they are to be known collectively as “Ethereum.”\n\nThe critical step in this direction will be the upcoming “merge,” a future upgrade in which the current Proof-of-Work chain will unite with the Proof-of-Stake Chain. It is scheduled tentatively in June 2022.\nProof-of-Stake is a consensus system requiring validators to stake their funds on the network to validate new transactions. Ethereum’s move from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake is intended to enable greater scalability and eventually lower transaction costs.\n\nIn the post, the team aired concerns that the existing terms, Ethereum 1.0 and 2.0, have the potential to confuse new users—it wrote that users “intuitively think that Eth1 comes first and Eth2 comes after. Or that Eth1 ceases to exist once Eth2 exists. Neither of these is true.” Per the team, after the upgrade takes place this year, there will no longer be two distinct networks—or even concepts—of ETH 1.0 and ETH 2.0. The two will simply be separate but integral components of the overall network known as Ethereum.\n\nAnother critical objective behind the rebranding was the prevention of scams. The team aims to prevent users from getting scammed by malicious entities who have taken advantage of the confusion created by the numerical names for Ethereum Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake chains. Such scams sometimes involve tricking users into believing they must “migrate” their ETH to ETH\xa0 2.0, resulting in lost funds.\n\nSource: https://cryptobriefing.com/ethereum-scraps-eth-2-0-in-roadmap-rebrand/', 1643119363], ['[removed]', 1643119751], ['While he is kind of right, if you haven\'t sold all the way down and want to sell now, you\'re kinda late.\n\nBut back in July Jim Cramer ""sold the bottom"" so it\'s probably best to do the opposite of what he says.

Exchanges are meant to direct cryptocurrency transactions between two interested parties. The traditional exchange we've had for a number of years is centralized, places like Binance, Coinbase and KuCoin. Now comes DEX(Decentralized Exchanges). Decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges are aimed at solving problems that are inherent to centralized exchanges. For example, centralized exchanges are managed by companies focused on making a profit and DEX are independent from regulators. \n\nUniswap runs on the Ethereum network, but with the massive traffic and price surge Ethereum has become bloated. Essentially you can swap coins in that DEX and it uses ETH as GAS. It doesn't make sense to use this instead of alternatives that are available right now because it's expensive and it takes a while.\n\nThat's where BNB comes into play, their network.. Binance Smart Chain isn't congested and doesn't cost a lot to transact with using BNB as GAS. Furthermore, BNB is an exchange coin where if you hold a specific amount you get discounts on exchange rates in Binance(centralized).

Regardless of a large crash stemming from “untethering Bitcoin”, crypto still fills in economic market opportunities. Examples include working as a currency (lightning network for BTC or PoS instead of PoW protocols like ADA), use of decentralized exchanges or yield farming by providing liquidity, staking, anonymity, preventing government control over a monetary system, etc. Just to name a few.\n\nA catastrophic crash doesn’t erase these uses and the need to fulfill these needs in the market. The solutions will keep interest in crypto alive and cushion the fall far from reaching $0. If anything, it will remind people that crypto is not a get rich quick scheme but a chance to become your own bank. \n\nWhen the individual is capable of providing peer-to-peer transactions, currency-swaps, loans, and other banking services then society takes control of their own money and leaves banks behind. The money that once would have been in control of the banks is now in the hands of the people. That is the real wealth distribution that the people deserve and cryptocurrency aligns with those goals very well.\n\nA crash may occur, but the intrinsic value in cryptocurrencies will keep it afloat and allow for its adoption to grow as more people understand the potential.

It uses SHA-256 (Bitcoin\'s hash function) to timestamp transactions when they are added to Solana block.  A new block on Solana is generated every 400ms (compared to Ethereum’s roughly 15 seconds and Bitcoin’s 10 minutes).  This is described by Yakovenko as Proof of History (PoH).\n\nThis allows Solana to process 50-65 000 transactions per second with a theoretical limit of over 70, 000 transactions per second (compared to Bitcoin’s 7 TPS and Ethereum’s 15 TPS).  \n\nSolana does not use Delegated PoS.  In contrast to other PoS cryptocurrencies, there is [no minimum stake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSAq1J_MJQQ) required to be a node on the Solana blockchain. While Leader selection is pseudorandom, the amount of SOL you stake also influences your likelihood of becoming a Leader which actually produces blocks.  \n\nThe key takeaway about Solana is that it allocates **different tasks to different nodes on the network** as needed to optimize speed, and all transactions are timestamped to ensure they are correct. \n\n**What is SOL?**\n\nSOL is the native token of Solana chain. It is used to pay Solana clusters (A group of nodes working for same cause) and burned to pay fees on Solana network. It can also be Staked to be become a Solana Node.\n\n**It is not clear at this, point of time, whether SOL is deflationary or inflationary.**\n\nWhile private (4) funding rounds started from 2018, a Public ICO was done in March 2020. Solana sold 1.76M SOL at $0.22/SOL. Solana raised over 25 million USD in funding across these five rounds.\n\nThis year it has come up on the radar of every trader as SOL saw [monumental gains](https://decrypt.co/69026/solana-sets-new-ath-while-rest-of-market-stagnates) when every other crypto was dropping. This gain in price can be attributed to its new developments in DeFi sector as well as launch of several new projects on the network thanks to Solana Summer. We can also see Solana Foundation partner with several big projects like Chainlink, Terra, Akash and Tether.\n\n**Recent Updates**\n\n1.

Wanted to share my thoughts on Solana, a blockchain platform that I believe has the most upside potential of the top \\~15 cryptocurrencies currently on the market.\n\n  \n**The Founding Story (**[Source](https://docs.solana.com/history)**)**\n\n* **Solana\'s Founder Anatoly Yakovenko spent the bulk of his professional career at Qualcomm, Dropbox, and Mesosphere** where he spent a lot of time designing distributed systems and figuring out how to get different systems of software and hardware to talk to each other \n* It was at Qualcomm that Anatoly met two of his other **Solana co-founders, Greg Fitzgerald and Stephen Akridge** and the three of them spent nearly a decade working together \n* **Greg had an expertise in languages** and compilers and he convinced Anatoly to migrate Solana’s codebase from the C programming language to Rust and became the CTO of Solana \n* **Stephen led the GPU backend that constantly beat Nvidia** and he demonstrated that massive amounts of time could be saved through GPUs leading Anatoly to recruit him to the team in early 2018 \n* The **Solana founding team had about a decade of experience working together** solving complex software and hardware problems at Qualcomm and **you don’t find many founding teams with such deep qualified shared work histories like this in the crypto space** \n* Solana was the name of a beach in San Diego where the three of them would often surf so the name doesn’t really have particular significance beyond that \n\n**Proof of Work vs. Stake vs. History** \n\n* **What sets Solana apart from its competitors is its core innovation, Proof of History**\n* To understand Proof of History and why it’s different, we first need to go over the method Bitcoin made famous which is proof of work and this is what Ethereum currently uses as well (explaining this for the beginners on the sub)\n   * For **proof of work**, when person A sends a transaction to person B through a blockchain, there are 1000s of computers also known as miners that work to confirm the transaction by solving tiny math problems and once a\xa0number of computers agree that a transaction is correct, then the transaction goes through, a block is produced, and the computers are rewarded with tokens like Bitcoin or Ethereum\n      * **This basically is the essence of the buzzword decentralization** you hear so often because instead of one centralized system like the US Treasury that mints money, a crowd of people are earning money in the form of tokens through computers \n      * There are large mining farms across the world that have thousands of computers making\xa0computations to earn tokens through Proof of Work and this has caused many to worry about all the electricity consumption cryptocurrency mining is resulting in \n      * **But the bigger problem with proof of work is that it’s much too slow** with Bitcoin and Ethereum both struggling to\xa0scale beyond 15 transactions per second and **in addition to that, average fees per transaction currently (as of 5/19/21) sit at** [$13 for bitcoin](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3m) **and** [$21 for Ethereum](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/ethereum-transactionfees.html#3m) which is just way too high \n   * In interviews, Anatoly states that he views Bitcoin and Ethereum more as revolutionary proof of concept products rather than platforms structured to serve worldwide audiences (debatable point of view ofc)\n      * **Bitcoin** proved that cryptography could be used to create currencies while **Ethereum** proved that blockchain technology could be used for smart contracts BUT **neither were built with the knowledge of how massive crypto would get and how transaction fees would skyrocket**\n* The next development to improve upon Proof of Work is called **Proof of Stake**, which is something Ethereum is trying to migrate to but there have been many delays \n   * **In proof of work,** the miners who are willing to spend more on energy consumption are selected to confirm the transactions on the blockchain \n   * **In proof of stake,** miners are called validators and validators are chosen based on the amount of money they lock away or how much they have ""staked"" and the more validators have staked, the more likely they will be chosen to confirm transactions and thus earn tokens \n      * If a bad actor tries to attack the network or do something sketchy, the tokens he/she has ""staked"" will be taken away (this is known as slashing) and provides a layer of protection against bad actors\n      * **PoS completely gets rid of the need to\xa0consume massive amounts of energy** and is a much more sophisticated approach that many cryptocurrencies have migrated to \n* This is where Solana\'s **Proof of History** comes in \n   * Solana still uses proof of stake as its method of verifying blocks, but Anatoly pushed it forward by creating a consensus mechanism called Proof of History and this is at the core is what makes Solana unique \n   * **The trouble with decentralized systems is that you have thousands of computers working together to verify transactions but they each use their own clocks and don’t have a common notion of time**\n      * As a result, most blockchain\xa0infrastructures require validators to talk to each other to agree on the time before verifying transactions and producing the next block \n      * **This results in notable delays in the network and is the reason Bitcoin produces blocks only every 10 minutes and Ethereum every 15 seconds**\n      * Here\'s an analogy: imagine that there is an army of 1000 soldiers who in this analogy represent each validator. Each soldier has his own watch and so the time to each soldier is what he believes the time to be, but the actual time may be off by a few seconds or minutes \n      * This means that if a general wants the solders to execute an order at a very specific time, he needs to get all the soldiers to agree on the time before that order is fulfilled correctly which is basically what is happening in current blockchain infrastructures \n   * **With Proof of History, all computers on the network agree on a universal time through what’s called a SHA-256, sequential-hashing\xa0verifiable delay function**\n      * **Proof of history results in 0 delays in the network and no waiting around for other validators to agree on the time**\n      * **As a result, while most of the latest proof of stake blockchains have blocktimes of a few seconds, Solana is able to achieve blocktimes of 0.4 seconds, and this is why Proof of History is a giant leap forward**\n\n**Why Solana is a Gamechanger (**[reference this chart for this section](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0OrBZkVEAQ8HJK?format=jpg&amp;name=medium)**)**\n\n* The primary reason is **Solana’s ability to scale** \n   * Solana can currently achieve **blocktimes of 0.4 seconds** and **65,000\xa0transactions per second** which makes **Solana one of the\xa0fastest blockchain infrastructures in the world** \n   * What’s more is that as internet bandwidth and CPU and GPU improve, **block times can reduce and transactions per second can increase theoretically scale to infinity** with a 1gb network supporting about 700,000 TPS and a 10 gb network being able to support 7 million TPS\n      * To be fair, this is true for most other crypto platforms as well\n   * In comparison, **Visa requires 65,000 transactions per second**, and the **NASDAQ exchange requires 500,000, so Solana can support databases at any scale**\n      * This is an extremely important development because applications as large as Facebook or exchanges like the NASDAQ can eventually be built on the Solana platform without performance issues and without enormous fees \n* Solana’s capabilities are also better understood when compared against the competition \n   * **Solana currently supports the highest transactions per second for a crypto with a working product** (this is from my knowledge, please correct me if I\'m mistaken) \n      * Though Ethereum 2.0 can scale to 100K transactions per second, the upgrade has yet to come\n      * Cardano\'s hydra solution can scale to 1MM per second, but has no mainnet (launching in August 2021)\n   * But more importantly, **Solana is miles ahead in block time versus the rest of the field due to proof of history and block times will also come down with time as well** with Anatoly on the record saying he envisions messages across Solana traveling at the speed of light \n   * In addition, **Solana also offers extremely low transaction costs at $0.00001 meaning that 1 million transactions would only cost $10 and Solana also has more validators than the rest** of the field besides Avalanche ([chart reference](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0OrBZkVEAQ8HJK?format=jpg&amp;name=medium))\n   * Github stars is a bit of a vanity metric and are similar to Facebook likes but basically even though Solana has only been around for a few years, it has a **pretty high number of Github stars which slightly demonstrates the interest developers have in the project** ([chart reference](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0OrBZkVEAQ8HJK?format=jpg&amp;name=medium))\n   * And lastly **Solana is a complete layer 1 solution** meaning that everything is built on the Solana blockchain vs. Ethereum 2.0 and Polkadot which are two of Solana’s biggest competitors which utilize sharding ([chart reference](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E0OrBZkVEAQ8HJK?format=jpg&amp;name=medium))\n      * Sharding isn\'t a dealbreaker based on my research and I\'m an ETH holder just to be clear but I do think having everything on a Layer 1 solution is cleaner\n* All of this is\xa0why **Sam Bankman Fried, a prominent figure in the crypto community and founder of the exchange FTX, chose to operate Serum on Solana after a year of testing out different options** \n   * In case you’re unfamiliar with it, FTX has been growing rapidly over the past 12 months and as a fun fact, the exchange recently paid for the rights to call the Miami Heat Arena FTX Arena \n\n**Why I Believe Solana Can 3X-5X**\n\n* The logic behind this is very simple and relates to **relative valuation** and this also is based on the assumption that the crypto market continues its bull run\n   * Personally, I think we\'re in the mid to late stages of a crypto bubble, so what I\'ve written below will not come true if the market collapses\n* **As of 5/18/21, Solana\'s Market Cap = $14.6BN, Polkadot = $36.4BN, Cardano = $64.5BN**\n   * I think Solana\'s tech makes it a pretty **undervalued cryptocurrency** just compared to other projects currently on the market\n      * I\'m not trying to ding other cryptos or say that other projects are bad, just saying I think Solana should be worth more than it is today based on these market caps\n   * Why is this? I\'m not sure, and perhaps it\'s because it\'s a relatively new project (founded in 2018) vs. the other ones so not as many investors are aware\n      * **It\'s also possible I may have missed something, so please let me know if there is reason to doubt Solana or if other projects are just far superior**\n   * Anyhow, all this is why if I had to choose one coin the top 15 right now, I would bet on Solana, and I am personally invested in it right now (for full disclosure)\n\n**TLDR**:\xa0 Solana is one of the most performant blockchains in the crypto space, using an innovative technology called Proof of History to solve the scalability problem currently faced by earlier technologies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum 1.0. Solana has the potential to 3X-5X, considering that it has superior technology compared to many competitors that have much higher market caps and much fewer actual projects in their ecosystems.', 1621353372], ['[removed]', 1621409385], ['[removed]', 1621409467], ['[removed]', 1621409501], ['', 1621438383], ['I’ve never heard anyone on here talk about it.

Tether is believed by many to be a scam, waiting to bring the whole market down. Thus the flippening, would be a godsend. Alas, this is not the case. Not because USDC is/has been shady itself (that will not be the point), but because the flippening is not even close to happening. There are 2 points to consider.\n\n   \n \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **The MarketCap (MC)**\n\nThe main claim regarding the flippening is that the MC of USDC will eclipse that of Tether. the main claim on the post is that the circulating supply of USDC is higher than that of USDT in the Ethereum network. Let's see how MC is calculated\n\nMC= Circulating Supply x Value of the asset\n\nPretty straightforward. The question is, can you compare marketcaps? Of course! Everyone does it with stocks, commodities, why not crypto. They would be right. Apart from this case. \n\n**Both USDT and USDC are** **stablecoins pegged to the Dollar. This means the individual asset value is equal.**\n\nThe MC difference between those two is only based on the difference in Circulating Supply. So how should we compare the 2? Enter the next point\n\n   \n \n\n**2.** **The Volume**\n\nThis is even more straightforward. The Volume is how much of the asset is actually traded. Personally, I believe that the volume is an even more clear indicator about an asset's strength, in a low liquidity market like the Crypto space. This is not the point though. Let's get back to our stablecoins.\n\nYou can check the volume of USDT and USDC on CMC. The USDT has a wooping 102B daily volume. USDC has... 8.6B. Pretty big huh? In simple words, this means that when checking which stablecoin is used in the market, **USDT is used 11 times more frequently than USDC**. This is the true indicator of strength in a stablecoin. The flippening will happen when the volume of USDC surpasses the volume of Tether. \n\nHopefully this helps. Apologies for format/grammar errors.\n\n   \n \n\n**TLDR: Tether is not getting flipped by USDC as MC/Circulating Supply does not matter in stablecoins, only volume, and Tether has 11x the volume of USDC.**"", 1642852231], [""https://i.imgur.com/Z9nPHJj.jpg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/tKh7Hl9.jpg\n\nwell ProtonSwap just came out yesterday. and since the entire market is taking a huge shit right now, might at well lend and earn some interest in your holdings. you can lend ETH, DOGE, XPR Proton, and XMT as well and earn interest.

(Ethereum, Solana, and Algorand do not do that)\n* Stellar is a big partner of Wirex which is a principal member of Visa and a principal member of MASTERCARD and has already issued 26 stablecoins on Stellar that can be used seamlessly in day-to-day life – online, at ATMs and in shops, restaurants and supermarkets – **thanks to the Wirex Visa card.**\n* Another principal member of Visa is Coinbase which provides a Coinbase card of 4% XLM cashback\n* Coinbase and Circle partnered together and now known as Centre which issues USDC, and USDC just launched on Stellar for additional main purposes as mentioned by them directly on their blog: cross-border payments, moving money around, merchant and business payments, and currency conversion.\n* [Velo and Lightnet](https://www.lightnet.io) use Stellar Blockchain for processing payments, remittances, and cross-border payments which have also obtained partnership with Visa for developing payment solution in Asia \n* Mastercard is looking for cryptocurrency focused on compliance, regulated, and is meant to be used\n\n\n##Why Visa will Use Stellar over Ethereum, Solana, and Algorand \n\nI will keep it brief.\n\n- Ethereum has scalability and high transaction cost problems (Eth 2.0 is still a long way to go)\n- Solana claims to process 50,000 tps/second which is indeed incredible for processing payments, but Solana lacks the built-in compliance frameworks that Stellar has and cross-currency conversion   (path payment) that Stellar does so well (USD&gt;XLM&gt;EUR) at a fraction of a cent(0.0001 XLM) within 2 seconds\n- Algorand also has use cases for stablecoins and payments but just like Solana, Algorand lacks the path payment feature of Stellar and regulatory compliance frameworks\n- Out of the 3, no one has partnered with Visa when it comes to processing payments using their networks, facilitating cross-border payments, Visa cards nor remittances compared to Stellar which its 4 partners (Velo, Lightnet, Centre, and Wirex) **are principal members of Visa and developing payment solutions** in remittances, cross-border payments, merchant payments, and multi-currency exchange **all powered by Stellar Blockchain with XLM as the bridge asset** and  issuing crypto-backed Visa debit cards. Out of Solana, Ethereum, Algorand and other chains, Stellar is the home of Stablecoins with stablecoins not found on any other blockchains and are regulated by financial institutions providing easy on/off ramp for facilitating borderless and online payments.\n\n\n##Why USDC on Stellar and XLM have the Biggest Chance to be Picked by Mastercard\n\nFrom [Mastercard itself:](https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2021/why-mastercard-is-bringing-crypto-onto-our-network/)\n\n&gt; We will be very thoughtful about which assets we support based on our principles for digital currencies, which focus on consumer protections and compliance.\n\n&gt; What are we looking for? Four key items.\nFirst and foremost we need consumer protections, including privacy and security of consumers’ information — the same level of security people have come to expect in their credit cards. Next, strict compliance protocols will be needed, including Know Your Customer, a requirement meant to snuff out illegal activity and deception in \xa0payment networks. Also, these digital assets must follow local laws and regulations in the regions they are used.\n\n&gt; Lastly, people will want to use these digital assets for payments, so that is one of our criteria too. To reach our network, crypto assets will need to offer the stability people need in a vehicle for spending, not investment.\n\nStablecoin is likely to be the first one to be supported here. USDC is the best candidate since it is fully-compliant and fully-backed by USD. Now, USDC on Stellar is cheap and fast and serves the purpose that Mastercard is aiming: used for payment. Every USDC transaction on Stellar will need XLM to process it thus burning XLM. \n\nOn the other hand, Mastercard will also allow merchants to accept volatile cryptos as a payment via an opt-in and that’s where XLM is gaining more bullish points: fast and cheap. \n\nYes, other cryptos are as fast as XLM and Bitcoin and Ethereum might even be *chosen* though they are slow with high tx fee, *since they are the most popular cryptos,* they still stand a chance. What makes XLM different tho is the network it runs on which is Stellar. \n\nStellar has the built-in compliance tools which banks and financial institutions are looking out for. \n\nAnd why Stellar over other blockchains? Wirex has this as a [response](https://wirexapp.com/blog/post/xlm-launches-on-the-back-of-a-game-changing-partnership-0150):\n\n&gt; When it came to choosing a blockchain on which to build our stablecoins, Stellar stood head and shoulders above the competition for several reasons:\n* As an FCA-regulated company, regulatory compliance is our priority. The Stellar protocol features an inbuilt compliance framework, automatically ensuring regulatory adherence\n* The majority of existing stablecoins are built on the Ethereum blockchain which processes roughly 25 transactions-per-second (tps). Stellar manages at least 1,000 tps, making it significantly faster and more scalable\n* Stellar and Wirex share a common goal and values – to bank the unbanked, democratise access to financial services and facilitate the integration of the burgeoning token economy\n\n##The Future\n\nYou might say that the future of finance should be DeFi, but the adoption of blockchain tech and cryptos by CeFi pave the way to legitimize the use cases of cryptocurrencies as a payment.\n\nFurthermore, while others are busy claiming that we don’t need banks, Stellar is getting them onboarded to a decentralized ledger. \n\nAnother take on this is that few seem to realize that the collapse of the banks and fiat in general will also be the collapse of the economy. When that happens, you can’t eat Bitcoin or XLM. You won’t even have enough fiat to to even buy cryptos.\n\nI think the future is not about replacing the centralized finance rather it is the co-existing of DeFi and CeFi where people have the choice which one they will use.\n\n\n##More about Stellar:\n\n**Trade cryptos and metals like Silver, Gold, Palladium and Platinum using Stellar DEX:**\n- lumenswap.io (it looks like Uniswap but for a fraction of a cent since it runs on Stellar)\n- www.stellarport.io\n- www.stellarx.com\n- www.lobstr.co', 1613072287], ['I’m thinking about jumping in some stable coins and go to AAVE, Yieldapp, Nexo and Celsius.

There are stablecoins for instance that will always equal to value of the asset they represent, for instance 1 USDC will always be valued ad 1 US dollar. There are tokens that give you access to protocols that earn interest on your deposits, like COMP. There are tokens that are backed by real world assets, ie 1 PAXG  is backed by one ounce of gold.

""Gas"" on the ethereum network is basically the fee you pay to transact on the network.

This congestion has caused transaction costs to be very high, and it can cost on the order of $30 to place a trade on Uniswap.

The network projected an increased network utilization while acknowledging that there might be some shortcomings.\xa0\xa0\n\n“Yes, we anticipate periods of high demand, network congestion at times. We’re on an exciting journey, and usage will be high. While we may at times feel impatient, this is the way. Here’s how we will optimize and scale as we grow,” IOHK said.\xa0\n\n#**Cardano’s 2022 scaling plan**\xa0\n\nPart of the scaling is the increase in block size to facilitate more transactions. The block size was recently increased by 8KB to 72KB.\xa0\nThe company also announced pipelining, a feature that will improve block propagation times. Cardano stated that its goal is to propagate at least 95% of peers within five seconds.\xa0\nElsewhere, IOHK aims to enhance block propagation by improving consistency through scaling up input endorsers. The endorsers improve block propagation times enabling transactions to be separated into pre-constructed blocks.\xa0\nAdditionally, Cardano has also lined up improvements for its smart contracts platform, Plutus. The Plutus script will be enhanced by focusing on the effective usage of the EUTXO model through smart contract optimization. Notably, Cardano’s smart contract capability is already registering growth. As per Finbold’s\xa0report, the number of smart contracts based on Plutus are steadily rising nearing the 1,000 milestone.\xa0\nThe staking feature will also likely undergo improvements by enhancing memory and CPU parameters for Plutus.\xa0\n\nFurthermore, Cardano seeks to promote even distribution of stake and reward computations across the epochs through node enhancements.\n\nCardano’s off-chain solutions will also focus on sidechains that serve as a separate blockchain linked to the main blockchain. The enhancement will enable assets to move between chains.\n\nIOHK also stated that it would focus on the Hydra functionality that introduces isomorphic state channels to minimize latency in a low to no cost environment. The scaling will eventually reduce storage requirements.\nOff-chain computing functionality will also help Cardano drive greater core network efficiency for transactions executed outside the blockchain.\n\nAs part of Cardano’s scaling-up initiatives for 2022, the platform will focus on the Mithril feature. The feature seeks to achieve greater scalability while improving chain synchronization while maintaining trust.\xa0\nOver the past year, the Cardano network development stood out and continued to attract more participants on the network. In this line, as\xa0reported\xa0by Finbold, Cardano was the most developed cryptocurrency project on Github in 2021, alongside Kusama and Polkadot.\xa0\n\nAs the Cardano network experiences growth, the platform is also focusing on sustainability. Recently, the Cardano Foundation\xa0revealed\xa0that a restoration project using Cardano had attained a target of planting over one million trees.\xa0\n\n#**ADA’s price**\xa0\n\nConsequently, the network developments are likely to impact the price of ADA, Cardano’s native token. By press time, the token was trading at $1.45, surging 23% in seven days.\xa0\n\nWith the network growth, projections indicate the asset will likely surge in value sustaining the bullish momentum in the process.

The project is a DPoS based platform built on Terdermint (Cosmos) for issuing stablecoins and is focussed on defi adoption by end users. One of the apps Chai offering contactless payments is really big in Korea with millions of users and backed by giants like SoftBank. Chai is also used by retail players like Nike and Phillip Morris. Being based on Tendermint, the transaction fees on Luna are very tiny (in cents). \n\n2. Terra natively supports stablecoins in multiple fiat currencies like USD and KRW. For each USD worth stablecoin issued on Terra, an equal value worth LUNA is burnt as issuance tax. For example, lets say right now LUNA =$6, so for each new UST issued 0.16 LUNA is burnt. This results in deflationary supply. \n\n3. Stablecoins on the Luna/Terra platform are used by DeFi applications, and one such application is Mirror protocol which lets you invest in synthetic assets such as stocks, commodities etc. Mirror is currently the second largest synthetic DeFi protocol and offers DEX based trading of assets like MSFT, QQQ, TSLA, AMZN, AAPL etc and associated liquidity mining rewards. For each mAsset issued, Luna also requires to be locked up. Also usage of Mirror increases UST circulation, resulting in additional Luna burn. \n\n4. Luna has recently raised funds from players like Coinbase ventures, Galaxy digital etc. Several more projects like Anchor, Spar will be launched soon and they will follow Mirror's distribution model i.e. rewarding existing users and stakers in the ecosystem. Anchor plans to develop native interest rate protocol for DeFi. Spar is a DeFi asset management protocol. Some of the projects plan to offer weekly distribution model. \n\nProtip: If you held Uniswap tokens in a wallet, you could already be eligible for Mirror distribution."", 1614763668], ['[removed]', 1614807554], ['', 1615216872], ['[removed]', 1615266423], ['', 1615283767], ['', 1615467314], ['', 1615671675], ['', 1615733457], ['[removed]', 1615758132], ['Apparently it was said on FB and twitter', 1615758571], ['[removed]', 1615884351], [""I don't think I've ever seen a post or seen any comments mentioning it.

You can simply deposit the UST within the anchor protocol for a relatively risk free (i.e. no impermanent loss, stable APR) at 20% apr or more.  (This would also be great for a bear market as their goal is to keep the APR stable above 20%, you dont even need to go through the collateral / borrow to do this and just deposit UST stablecoin)\n\n2.  You can create liquidity for Anchor by taking half of your UST and swapping for the Anchor token and staking the Anchor-UST LP.  This has a high APR in excess of 100% however, you open yourself up to impermanent loss\n\n3.  If your bullish on Anchor, you can swap all your UST for Anchor and stake the Anchor token on the protocol and receive around 2% (likely not recommended due to poor returns)\n\n4.  You can use Mirror Protocol and create a liquidity token for a variety of pools, such as UST-Mirror and get rewarded in Mir.  This would be a good option if you are bullish on Mirror.   Mirror protocol is very interesting as you can also swap your UST for synthetic mAssets for stocks such as Tesla, Google, Apple and more.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nTo exit, you do the reverse of the above steps, pay back your borrowed amount in UST and then burn or unbond your bLuna to Luna (or you can use TerraSwap if you dont want to wait the 21 days for anchor protocol to burn your bLuna at a higher cost)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe coolest feature about all of this is that you not only are reaping the potential increase in value of Luna, you are also getting rewarded for staking in liquidity pools -or- for depositing your UST on Anchor.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**See this website for experimental potential payout:**  www.anchor-simulator.com\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n***This is not financial advice, Terra / Anchor / Mirror are all newer protocols, and have inherent risks.

You could keep bLUNAs on reserve in cash your loan gets close to liquidation, but if there's another time when the bLUNA to LUNA price increases like last night but your loan is still safe, you could then sell your bLUNA reserves for LUNAs and cash in on the arbitrage opportunity."", 1618768709], [""Hey folks.

All you need to do is hit 1 per year and you're golden. \n\nHowever, the vast majority of someone's portfolio should be safer coins like the one's mentioned. \n\nThese 3 especially give investors stability that comes with top coins, but also some hidden upside since these are off most people's radar currently. \n\nIf we're being honest, most people really don't even know much about these 3 coins and why they're so awesome.\n\nLet's start with Chainlink. It's built on the Ethereum chain and it acts as an Oracle Network.\n\nIn simple terms, this means that Link is able to pull data from off chain sources and integrate it with on chain data. \n\nThis sounds complicated, but when you see a real world example, it's makes sense why Link is primed for take off.\n\nOne thing I'm seeing with alot of [\\#p2e](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/p2e?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZX9bbuFzd9eviAyOStSAxQ4mi-quRXpZzs-C9AvCSgNcoL0OAb4Bbzi2jmM_bMBgFVtWiY4XUQffw4im4OVDuxQj1dpekoxqk7ntccHi3o6ctfomF9hO4s0SJO0tn4Rc3uv_26ZKKujWr9wHAgUONu9&amp;__tn__=*NK-R) is that these games are implementing Link's Oracle system. \n\nGames generally require some time of randomization to keep things interesting. IE: Dice rolls or card draws\n\nJust because something happens on the blockchain, doesn't mean its random.\n\nWhat ChainLink does is use an outside system of data for randomization. Then Link integrates the results with mechanisms in game that require randomized events.\n\nIt's really just a fancy way of having a blockchain roll dice or draw cards for you.\n\nIf you are of the belief that Play To Earn will be a big part of 2022, it's reasonable to feel that projects tied to gaming will experience similar or greater success.\n\nIt's very likely Link will see greater long term success than most games since it's utility can be used in many niches.\n\nAlso, If you look at the start of the bull run, It was ChainLink that started it off and it was ChainLink that was one of the first tokens to take a major dip once the trend started to change. It has the due up factor on it's side.\n\nThe next coin primed for a stealth take off is Algorand. If you are dialed into crypto, you've probably liked this coin for a while even though it's kinda boring. \n\nPrice wise, we heard next to nothing from Algo in 2021, but I expect that to change in 2022.\n\nWhat excites me most about boring ol' Algo is that governments and public sectors all across the world have been quietly implementing it. \n\nFor example, in Miami, the city uses the Algorand blockchain to check the air quality. It's very likely this could become a nationwide standard in the near future.\n\nWe recently saw the Marshall Islands select the Algorand blockchain to power their first national digital currency. \n\nThe currency will operate alongside the US dollar. It very well could end up being the model for how crypto is scaled out to replace the physical dollar.\n\nFinally, we are also seeing Algo being used to implement 5G and grow artificial intelligence. We can all agree that both of these spaces will very prevalent the next 5-10 years.\n\nLast but not least is my personal favorite on the list, Polkadot. I've been huge fan of Dot for a couple years now. \n\nDot is the start to fixing the biggest problem in crypto right now... Connectivity between chains. \n\nRight now you can't easily send tokens or data from one chain to the other. Let's say [\\#ETH](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/eth?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZX9bbuFzd9eviAyOStSAxQ4mi-quRXpZzs-C9AvCSgNcoL0OAb4Bbzi2jmM_bMBgFVtWiY4XUQffw4im4OVDuxQj1dpekoxqk7ntccHi3o6ctfomF9hO4s0SJO0tn4Rc3uv_26ZKKujWr9wHAgUONu9&amp;__tn__=*NK-R) to [\\#BNB](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/bnb?__eep__=6&amp;__cft__[0]=AZX9bbuFzd9eviAyOStSAxQ4mi-quRXpZzs-C9AvCSgNcoL0OAb4Bbzi2jmM_bMBgFVtWiY4XUQffw4im4OVDuxQj1dpekoxqk7ntccHi3o6ctfomF9hO4s0SJO0tn4Rc3uv_26ZKKujWr9wHAgUONu9&amp;__tn__=*NK-R). Sure, there is a process called bridging, but not everyone can do it and not all data can be bridged.\n\nHere comes Dot to the rescue. Polkadot is designed to move not only tokens, but also data or smart contracts across blockchains. \n\nIt's why I love Dot so much. In a world where everything aim's to be the Ethereum killer. Dot aim's grow the Blockchain space. It really highlights what the blockchain community is all about.\n\nAll this sound cool, but you're probably wondering why I think they could be primed to explode in the near future.\n\nAll of these coins had solid growth early in the bull run. However, they each spent most of last yr in what felt like an accumulations phase.\n\nIf it really were a year long accumulation phase for Dot, Algo, and Link and this bull run isn't over, their next pumps could be astronomical. \n\nEven if the bull run is over, with how I foresee the bear market playing out, I still see Dot, Algo, Link having a year of growth during a downswing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you enjoyed this write up, check out my project [SoLadsNFT.com](https://SoLadsNFT.com) We host a crypto school that is free for our holders.

I genuinely love both projects, but I'd like to concentrate on one for the time being because I don't have much money and don't want to split it up. So, what are your thoughts? \n\nInfo below: Polkadot is a sharded protocol that enables blockchain networks to operate together. Polkadot is an open-source project founded by the Web3 Foundation. The Polkadot coin serves three distinct purposes: governance over the network, staking, and bonding.\n\nPolygon (Previously Matic Network) is the first well-structured, easy-to-use platform for Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development.

SO stupid!"", 1643000230], ["" \n\nBackground:\n\nCryptocurrency has been the largest transfer of wealth within human history and the rate of transfer is continuing to grow.\n\nYou've probably heard of the new Chronos network chain that crypto dot com has recently started and wondered why the NFTs are being sold out within minutes of their release.\n\nExample: Chronos chimps were minted at 530 CRO and selling for above the 1,000+ CRO floor price.\n\nThere are a few points to note here.\n\nCrypto dot come is one of the largest crypto chains right now and its following is immense. This is associated with an incredibly high demand for the products on its network.\n\nThe projects, such as NFTs, are being released at a finite (fixed) supply.\n\nThe finite supply is usually a fraction of the number of potential purchasers.\n\nDue to the high demand, the initial price or minting price is typically substantially lower than the market-clearing price (equilibrium).\n\nNext Projects:\n\nBecause this is such a new service, there is still a limited number of projects that are being released on their chain. With this said, a few such as CROZebras (on twitter) are currently being developed. With this said, the utility associated with NFTs, have been poorly captured this far, however, they have a strong potential in areas such as art and music distribution, as well as reserved rights to other forms of digital information. This is combined the novel security that is associated with blockchain technology.\n\nCurrent Strategies and Conclusion:\n\nTo simplify the current market condition into a workable model that crypto investors can use to maximize profits, we must consider the following base of the network and how that transfers to its subnetworks.\n\nLarge crypto spaces with subnetworks that have only a few projects yield investments with limited supply and dramatically high demand.\n\nThe potential utility associated with NFTs has not been maximized, however, this represents a potential for future projects in areas such as art, music, and proprietary information.\n\nInvestors are able to use minting to secure low (or lower) cost assets that can be leveraged against the high demand and finite supply to maximize their potential return.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\\-NFTMASTER1010"", 1643001075], ['', 1643008948], ['[removed]', 1643031674], ['', 1643058927], ['', 1643067296], ['[removed]', 1643073503], ['ALGO, DOT, CRO and LINK could double and still be below their ATH.

Some of them think they’ve found the key to fast wins on the stock market. Wall Street doubts they’re right, but it’s getting nervous about what it sees there.\n\nHistory hasn’t been kind to people claiming to have a magic hand. The latest sell-off, driven by a new wave of coronavirus fears, shows how quickly markets can turn on you. But even veteran traders have trouble dismissing a 900,000-user Reddit forum called r/wallstreetbets, or r/WSB for short, whose tips and tactics have shown an uncanny ability to push prices, at least for the short term. Hitherto sleepy companies such as Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. and Plug Power Inc. went crazy shortly after being mentioned there. The board may have added a little froth to Tesla Inc.’s $90 billion rally.\n\nThe do-it-yourself traders of r/WSB are waging a kind of guerrilla warfare in the markets, trying to exploit what they see as weaknesses in the system to move prices where they want them. For anyone who wondered about where the small day traders who made the 1990s so wild went, meet the 2020 version. After years of indifference, individual investors seem to be finding their way back to stocks, for better or worse. They’re flexing muscles in ways that can easily call to mind excesses from the dot-com era.\nVirgin Galactic Stock Price\n\nData: Compiled by Bloomberg\n\n“There is no denying the fact that in the month of February 2020, the public is back,” says Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG LLC. He thinks the S&amp;P 500 can jump an extra 10% because of small-investor enthusiasm. “This bull market is not going to end until the public falls in love with stocks, and that process may just be beginning.” Of course, timing the moment when irrational exuberance gives way to a mass exit isn’t so easy. Chatrooms where stocks were hyped are seminal artifacts of the 1990s boom and the following bust. They were a setting for bare-fisted digital brawls among all manner of hustlers and promoters, many of whom could move shares on a dime—sometimes just enough so they could get out and leave others holding the bag.\nPlug Power Stock Price\n\nData: Compiled by Bloomberg\n\nTwenty years later, one thing that’s changed is the nomenclature. It’s frequently both juvenile and objectionable. For Reddit’s band of self-styled “autists”—a term of endearment, relatively speaking, that crudely leans into stereotypes surrounding extremely online people—the chief prize is “tendies” (chicken tenders, the treat an overgrown man-child receives for being a “Good Boy”). Figuratively speaking, tendies are the financial rewards that follow from a successful bold wager. Bears are usually referred to in homophobic terms.\n\nWhat this moment shares with 1999 is a rising belief that someone else will come along to buy a surging stock at an even higher price, regardless of fundamentals. But while traders at the end of the millennium were willing to wait around for a “greater fool” to show up, this generation believes it can conjure up those buyers through its own trading sleight of hand.\nrelates to Reddit’s Profane, Greedy Traders Are Shaking Up the Stock Market\nFeatured in Bloomberg Businessweek, March 2, 2020. Subscribe now.\nIllustration: Matija Medved for Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nMembers of r/WSB believe they’ve discovered a kind of perpetual motion machine in the interplay of stocks with options contracts, which offer a cheap way to bet on whether shares will rise or fall without buying the stock itself. It goes like this: Members make bets that rely on market makers, the professional middlemen who sell you a “call” (a bet on shares rising) or a “put” (a wager on a decline). Market makers, like good bookies, don’t want to go out on a limb. When taking a bet, they lay off the risk. If someone buys a call, for instance, speculating on a rally, the dealer buys stock in the underlying company. If the stock rises, the dealer may have to pay out on the option—but that’s offset by the gain on the shares.\n\nWhen shares keep rising, managing the hedge entails buying more stock. That’s where the Reddit set perceives a weakness. A favorite tactic on r/WSB is to swamp the market with call purchases early in the morning in an attempt to force dealers to keep buying stock. Up and up everything goes—supposedly. As the stock price rises, so does the value of the calls, often by far more.\n\nIn this worldview, the only constraint on success is the force of one’s own conviction and willingness to act upon it. An added attraction: It’s all relatively cheap in terms of an option’s simple dollar cost. For the price of one share of Amazon.com Inc.—about $1,965 on Feb. 25—a decent-size campaign can be waged in long-shot options trading for pennies. That matters nowadays, when the rise of exchange-traded funds and mutual funds has convinced U.S. companies that they no longer need to split their stocks to keep the share price manageable for retail investors. Many companies now trade for three or four figures a share.\n\nTo be clear, there’s no magic money machine in options. The middlemen of the market are hardly the only players buying and selling stocks. If the rest of the market sees a reason to sell a company, it won’t matter that r/WSB is pushing it. While options can produce eye-popping gains, they frequently expire worthless.\n\nBut suddenly bullish individual investors are putting their mark on the options market. How influential have they become? Typically puts are in higher demand than calls because traders are more interested in hedging against losses. That’s often not the case now—with some stocks, demand for the bullish calls is higher. “This is not normal,” said Amy Wu Silverman, an equity derivatives strategist at RBC Capital Markets, on Bloomberg TV recently.\n\nBenn Eifert, chief investment officer at QVR Advisors, was initially skeptical that the money behind these online message boards could sway anything. He changed his mind. “At least from the dealers”—the middlemen—“they’ll tell you in big tech names, flows are substantial, and it’s moving things,” he says. Smaller stocks are even more sensitive to sudden bursts of attention.\n\nBTIG’s Emanuel says it’s hard to say whether today’s chatrooms or those in the late 1990s have bigger sway. “When I was sitting in a proprietary trading room in 1999, you would see certain stocks be mentioned on message boards, and the process would then be one person saying to another, ‘Hey, this looks interesting,’\u2009” he says. “Now you see something on a message board, and you might not necessarily see a continued discussion.” Instead, computerized traders automatically jump in. “As a human you never actually see the flow because it’s going electronically,” Emanuel says. In other words, don’t just wag a finger at message boards—look at the supposedly sophisticated algorithmic traders that are following them.\n\nMembers are aware that questionable thinking underpins their bets, to the point of self-deprecation. After user SolTrainRnsOnHolGran wondered whether r/WSB’s activities might constitute insider trading, a user named recentlyunearthed replied, “How can we have insider knowledge when we don’t have any knowledge?”\n\nThe forum’s zest for call options is a key force behind a broad market trend. By one measure, the value of options traded rose 77% over the first six weeks of 2020. Much of this expansion was concentrated in a handful of stocks popular among individual investors, says John Marshall, head of derivatives research at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. “The size of the increase in options volumes is definitely moving the needle,” he says.\n\nThe average number of contracts purchased in a single-stock option trade shrunk to just 6.7 contracts in 2020, roughly half what it was in 2015, says Henry Schwartz, president of Trade Alert LLC.

Recently i've started seriously exploring Web3.  My investments in crypto are fairly minimal in the grand scheme of my portfolio.  I have as much invested in crypto as I have in synthetic biology, and whenever SpaceX goes public, i'll put an equal amount in there.  \n\nIt's become my opinion that our understanding of why crypto is useful is wrong.  It's a carry over from Bitcoin's founding.  I see some absolute gems of value in crypto still though, so i'm bullish on the idea, but I just think collectively we may have the wrong mental model. \n\nAs i've explored NFT's, it's become clear to me that Crypto is not our current economy mapped into the digital space, it is an entirely new economy.  It is unique in that the natural wealth of this new economy is fundumentally different from that of land in the meat universe.  But it DOES have natural wealth.  Blockspace is a fundumentally useful thing (the guy in that video says replicating data over and over again is ineffecient, but what it's doing is building resiliency).  Publically available ultra-resilient data connected to a guaranteed to execute VM (once the transaction is finalized it's guaranteed), controlled by no central entity is useful.  Expensive, but useful.\n\nWhat the blockchain does not do well is the real-world.  To a limited extent, it can handle events in the real world, but those are things that are easy to decentralize or where we have reliable public data which we can build into an Oracle.  The weather for example.  In my exploration, I tried to build a trustless eCommerce solution.  It becmae clear to me that the digitally native parts of the solution were superior to our current system, but the off-chain real world parts were inferiror.  Trustless interactions are not 100% always better.  Sometimes trusting someone makes for a better experience.  So its become my opinion that useful trusted relationships in the real-world should be maintained, and useful digitally native relationships should be moved on-chain.\n\nAnother interesting fact about NFT's, is that measured in their local currencies, they have maintined a relatively stable price.  The fluctuations of the forex market (if you want to think of imported dollars like that) has moved markets, but NFT's have remained stable.  One argument for why they have remained stable is that the market is relatively illiquid.  However, i'd argue you'd still see the floor move as people desperate lower their selling price to extract value and flee.  It just hasn't dumped in the same way.  When I talk to NFT guys, they don't measure the price in dollars, they measure in whatever the local currency is (ETH, I use AVAX).  Prices seem relatively sitcky, In much the same way milk doesn't really change when the price of the Euro moves relative to the dollar.  It's a localized economy.\n\nBlockspace will still be exported, but only where it makes sense.  Complex financial vehicles (priced in USD) will probably increasingly move on-chain.  These exports will fund the imported computational power needed to run the world.   It will find a way to be better than centralized services, because the compute power is a necessity for the new economy, and compute is a commodity not available natively."", 1643115963], ['Because the chains they’re going to (SOL, AVAX, ADA) are discovering they have the exact same problems they “ran away from” in the first place.', 1643116620], ['And yet they keep leaving developers keep going other chains money keeps going to other chains but to be fair ada and sol will prob die there falling apart daily and avax will prob do quite well copypasting others work and calling them subnets but never really be a leader itself.\n\n\n\nThe big change for eth comes when another chains smart contracts replace the EVM as youl prob check to see what chain i believe in il be straight algorand ran 14 million smart contracts in less than a day with zero slowdown zero fee increases a feat that would take a evm chain  like eth or matic or avax currently over 10 days if there was zero other txs with fees that would make it unfeasible.', 1643117086], ['DCA’d!

There is no secondary layer for processing smart contracts.\n\nTransactions in Hedera are processed in the order they are received. This means that you serially process the transactions in the order that they reach consensus. Each transaction type will have a different handle time, and contracts of varying length (Hedera is currently throttled at 15M gas per second but can process more than that) will execute in different amounts of time. All native services (crypto transfers, token operations \\[mint, create, burn, transfer, etc\\], and Consensus service \\[consensus-as-a-service\\]) run in less than 100 microseconds (1/ 100us = 10k TPS).

It is used to pay for gas fees and also for fees for joining or creating a subnet. There is a max supply of 720,000,000 coins and it is deflationary because a part of the fees is being burned. It also used for staking. A validator needs to stake at least 2,000 AVAX.\n\n**Personal thoughts**\n\nI think its a nice project and I like that its deflationary, but I honestly think that other projects like Ethereum and Polkadot are a better investment.

""\n\nThe main goal of Avalanche is to build a unifying plateform allowing for the creation, transfer &amp; trade of digital assets. It aims to be a scalable, secure, decentralized, governable &amp; democratic platform. \n\nIts founder, Emin Gün Sirer, was a professor at the Cornell University. He founded the Avalab that created the AVAX coin. He already created a proof of work cryptocurrency prototype in 2001, which caused many people to think he was actually Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\nFrom Coin Bureau : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9sUse76J5M&amp;t=1018s\n\nThe heart of the network is its consensus mechanism:\n\t- It uses subnets which are dynamic set of validators working together to achieve a consensus of the state of a set of blockchains. This is Required to create their custom mechanisms for their validators. As those mechanisms are custom, they can be both POS and POW.\n\t- The consensus was proposed by Team Rocket (lol) : brings older consensus (classical &amp; Nakamoto) together: it can apply a probabilistic approach to a standard consensus. It also can scale the network without compromizing security. \n\t\t○ For instance, it uses repeated sampling of the network. If at any point there is a supermajority of the nodes supporting a different value, the nodes will switch to that value. This is called gossiping. \n\t\t○ The mechanism can use both  POS &amp; POW for the subnets, as mentioned above.\n\t- The main benefit from this is that it makes it very costly to control the super majority and therefore increases the security.\n\t- DAG-optimized consensid protocol (= transactions can be run in parallel)\n\t- Scalable, secure &amp; decentralized. \n\t- The subnets can be limited to a certain number of validators --&gt; security &amp; privacy better!\n\t- Validators can choose which a particular subnet to join but they are all connected to the default subnet. Each blocks on all the other subnets can interact with the default subnet. (similar to polkadot with parachains!)\n\t- Virtual Machines: each blockchain in a subnet must specifies which VM it runs. \n\t\t○ Gives more customizations options to developers\n\t\t○ Complete support for Ethereum VM : all tools from Ethereum can be used (metamask,…)\n\t\t○ In future: plateform with more powerfull and diversified smart contracts will be developed.\n\nAVAX is the native token of the Avalanche network.\n\t- Pays for fees, for govenance &amp; staking\n\t- The Validators have to stake some avax to participate\n\t- Staking rewards are based on proof of uptime and rewards are newly minted avax\n\t- Initial requirement for validators: 2000 avax (will go down to 500)\n\t- Networks apps can create their own token but need AVAX for transaction fees\n\t- The fees are burned &amp; taken out of supply. Fees will differ according to type of transaction. For instance, a new subnet will be more expensive\n\t- The fees is not set by issuer of transaction but by a flobally verifiable fee-function.\n\t- On the supply side:\n\t\t○ Total supply: 720 million\n\t\t○ Emission function designed to reach that slowly, like bitcoin. Depends on how much avax is staked. \n\t\t○ Lock up period for stacking of 2 weeks for delegators &amp; validators\n\t\t○ Token holders can decide how fast the max cap is reached. \n\t\t○ Stacking return: 7-12% for the first year. \n\t\t○ For the seed tokens, there\'s a big lockup: 1 to 10 year after ICO. It only concerns a small amount. \n\n\nSome upgrades in the future: \n\t- Apricot : governance framework: token creators can freeze &amp; unfreeze tokens\n\t- Can use avax wrapped to be used on eth network\n\t\t○ Bridge avalanche Arc20 token to Ethereum ERC20 \n\t- OpenFi to evaluate projects on the blockchain like if they were real companies\n\t\t○ 1st big project: TUSD\n\t- Futur: quantum resistent subnets\n\t- Mobile &amp; browser extension wallet\n\t- Suite of DeFi applications\n\n\nBig potential:\n\t- Good tokenomics\n\t\t○ Half is for staking\n\t- Deflationary as burned for network fees\n\t- Already present in Turkey(super high inflation)\n\t- Team is apparently in talks with various central banks (not confirmed)\n\t- Over 50 partnership \n\n\n\nFrom CoinMarketCap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/\n\n\t- Actual Market cap: $3bn (12.7bn fully diluted)\n\t- Max Supply of 720bn token, with 390bn already created and a circulating supply of 173bn. \n\t- You can buy AVAX on Binance, KuCoin and others.\n\t- The binance wallet shows that 60 million tokens (out of 72millions on binance) are locked on a single wallet.

Neo (NEO): Blockchain application platform and cryptocurrency for digitized identities and assets, aiming to create a smart economy.\n1. Solana (SOL): another blockchain aimed at providing super-high-speed transactions. It claims to be able to process 50k transactions per second and be perfect to deploy scalable crypto applications.\n1. Dai (DAI): the decentralized stablecoin of MakerDAO, tied to the dollar.\n1.
